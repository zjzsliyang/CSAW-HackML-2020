\section*{Environment Setup}
Please see the \texttt{README} in the GitHub repository\footnotemark\footnotetext{\url{https://github.com/zjzsliyang/CSAW-HackML-2020}}. We introduce the dependencies as well as the bash commands to run the code.

\section*{Base Model Structure}
We implemented two approaches to detect and repair backdoored model. First is based on by \cite{wang2019neural} and second is based on \cite{gao2019strip}. These two approaches can can be divided into two parts, e.g. detecting the backdoor labels and repair the BadNets. Our models are based on the default model in the origin repo, as following Figure \ref{fig:base_structure} shows.

\section*{Neural Cleanse}
\subsection*{Detect Backdoors}
The key idea of Neural Cleanse\footnotemark\footnotetext{\url{https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~bolunwang/assets/docs/backdoor-sp19.pdf}} by  \cite{wang2019neural} is that if a model is poisoned, it requires much smaller modifications to cause the model to classify the wrong target label. So we decided to iterate all possible labels and check which one requires smaller modification to achieve the wrong result. The whole process will be divided into 3 steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the minimal trigger. We try to find a trigger window with a fixed label. We assume this label is the target label of the attack backdoor trigger. The performance of this trigger depends on how small it is to misclassify all samples from other labels into the target label.
    
    \item Iterate the whole label sets. We run the loop for iterating all labels in the model, which is 1283 in our project. In other words, 1283 potential triggers will be created after this step.
    
    \item Choose the valid trigger. We need to choose the valid trigger in all 1283 triggers. It depends on the number of pixels the trigger trying to influence in the models. Our method is to calculate the L1 norms of all triggers. Then we will calculate the absolute deviation between all data points and the median. If the absolute deviation of a data point divided by that median is larger than 2, we mark it as a target trigger. The target trigger which is most effective to misclassify the model will be the ``reverse trigger'' we need to repair BadNets.
\end{enumerate}
The implementation of the step 1 and 2 is in the \href{https://github.com/zjzsliyang/CSAW-HackML-2020/blob/master/visualize_example.py}{\texttt{visualize\_example.py}} and \href{https://github.com/zjzsliyang/CSAW-HackML-2020/blob/master/visualizer.py}{\texttt{visualizer.py}}.

The implementation of the step 3 is in the \href{https://github.com/zjzsliyang/CSAW-HackML-2020/blob/master/mad_outlier_detection.py}{\texttt{mad\_outlier\_detection.py}}.

\subsection*{Repair BadNets}
In order to repair BadNets, we decided to patch the infected model by pruning the poisoned neurons in the BadNet with the ``reverse trigger''.

The target trigger poisoned neurons in the model to make it misclassify the label, so we need to find these neurons and set their output value to 0 so that the model will not be affected by the trigger anymore. 

Therefore we rank the neurons by differences between clean input and poisoned input produced by the 'reverse triggers'. We again target the second to last layer, and prune neurons by order of highest rank first. In order to keep the performance of the model on clean target, we decided to stop the iteration as soon as the model is not sensitive to the poisoned input any more.

You can find details in the \href{https://github.com/zjzsliyang/CSAW-HackML-2020/blob/master/repair_model.py}{\texttt{repair\_model.py}}.
